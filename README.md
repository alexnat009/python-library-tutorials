# python-library-tutorials
---
 The repository is dedicated to learning different Python libraries such as OpenCV, Pandas, etc. My journey to studying different libraries.
 For now, these include:
 - OpenCV
 - Scikit-Learn
 - Pandas


## OpenCV
Exploring OpenCV functionalities through hands-on examples and documentation. It contains two main tutorial sources:
YouTube OpenCV Tutorial – Based on the ProgrammingKnowledge channel.
OpenCV User Guide Tutorial – Examples taken from the official OpenCV documentation.

#### Learning Goals

Understand fundamental OpenCV functions
Learn how to manipulate and process images
Work with edge detection, contours, and shape analysis
Implement real-world applications such as motion detection and object tracking

### Scikit-Learn
---
Deep dive into Scikit-Learn user guide and documentation.

#### Learning Goals

Understand fundamental Scikit-learn functions
Supervised, Unsupervised learning methods
Model Evaluation and Selection
Dataset transformation


### Pandas
---
Analyzing Pandas documentation and user guide

#### Learning Goals

Get familiar with Pandas essential functionality and data structures
Indexing and selecting data
Working with datasets


#### Note
---
Other libraries may be added later on as I progress with different concepts. This is my roadmap to improving at python, Machine Learning, and numerical programming.
